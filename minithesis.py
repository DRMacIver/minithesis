"""
This file implements a simple property-based testing library called
minithesis. It's not really intended to be used as is, but is instead
a proof of concept that implements as much of the core ideas of
Hypothesis in a simple way that is designed for people who want to
implement a property-based testing library for non-Python languages.

minithesis is always going to be self-contained in a single file
and consist of < 1000 sloc (as measured by cloc). This doesn't
count comments and I intend to comment on it extensively.


=============
PORTING NOTES
=============

minithesis supports roughly the following features, more or less
in order of most to least important:

1. Test case generation.
2. Test case reduction ("shrinking")
3. A small library of primitive possibilities (generators) and combinators.
4. A Test case database for replay between runs.
5. Targeted property-based testing
6. A caching layer for mapping choice sequences to outcomes


Anything that supports 1 and 2 is a reasonable good first porting
goal. You'll probably want to port most of the possibilities library
because it's easy and it helps you write tests, but don't worry
too much about the specifics.

The test case database is *very* useful and I strongly encourage
you to support it, but if it's fiddly feel free to leave it out
of a first pass.

Targeted property-based testing is very much a nice to have. You
probably don't need it, but it's a rare enough feature that supporting
it gives you bragging rights and who doesn't love bragging rights?

The caching layer you can skip. It's used more heavily in Hypothesis
proper, but in minithesis you only really need it for shrinking
performance, so it's mostly a nice to have.

    that fails.

    The test will be run immediately, unlike in Hypothesis where
    @given wraps a function to expose it to the the test runner.
    If you don't want it to be run immediately wrap it inside a
    test function yourself.

    Arguments:

    * max_examples: the maximum number of valid test cases to run for.
      Note that under some circumstances the test may run fewer test
      cases than this.
    * random: An instance of random.Random that will be used for all
      nondeterministic choices.
    * database: A dict-like object in which results will be cached and resumed
